# Welcome
Welcome to readers of Code Like a Girl: Rad Tech Projects + Practical Tips. 

This is github, and it may be the first time you've visited. Github is an open-source village where developers put their code. Open source means that anyone can see your code. They can test it out, borrow it (called "forking"), and even offer up some improvments and changes (called "making a pull request"). That means that you too can poke around and look at anyone's code, even borrow it -- use the Fork button at top right. For examples, try [here](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet) and [here](https://github.com/wangshub/wechat_jump_game)(Click translate!), or click into [Github Explore](https://github.com/explore). Sometimes you can grab info from the README.md file, or peek into the code files. Other times you'll need to fork the repo into the onesantander

Github is also a place where you can create and host your own web page. Here's a link from Kahn Academy that [shows you how](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github). 

But back to github. I've posted info about Code Like a Girl here so you'll have the chance to get familiar with github and code repositories in general (which as you can see, contain lots of written text too).
